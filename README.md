# Monkhaus-Online-Shop
A Bootstrap 4 Online Shop Project

此作品是我在學習及掌握了Bootstrap 4之後的個人專案，
為了讓作品呈現出個人一貫的設計理念及要領，
所以著手從最初的網頁設計、佈局到之後利用BS4搭建的過程皆由自己完成，
結果令自己頗滿意，在創作的過程中也對此框架語言及延伸的CSS知識有了
更深一層的熟稔度，收穫甚多。

This website is me exercising all I have learned from Bootstrap 4, 
which is also designed by myself to give it a flair of personal aesthetic. 
It is my first online shopping site coded by myself. The working process was 
pure joy, being able to build something from just ideas and drafts to frames, 
walls and in the end the whole building on your own.
